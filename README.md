Roman Numeral Conversion Coding Challenge

I spent approximately 2 hours working on the solution to this Challenge

My thought process was to first create a class that would be able to do the actual execution of the conversion. To do this I first created a map to pair each roman numeral with their respective decimal number. While converting from decimal to roman numerals, I struggled a lot with the subtraction rules. 4 kept outputting IIII and so I decided to make some vectors to pair the subtractive values directly. 

in the main function I decided to try and make it somewhat easy to navigate. You can specify whether you are converting A roman or decimal numeral, and it also takes into account potential user errors, so the program doesn't just shut down if it doesn't recognize any user input. If I were given more time, I would try to make it even more user friendly, make it so you can navigate back and forth between each type a bit better. For example, make it so I could submit as many Decimal numbers as I want to be converted before it cycles back to the initial prompt. 

I hope I submitted everything correctly, This is my first time creating a Github Repository.
